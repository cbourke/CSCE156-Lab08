### Lab Objectives & Topics

Following the lab, you should be able to:        

-   Connect to a database and execute queries

-   Perform basic Create, retrieve, update, and delete (CRUD) operations

-   Understand more complex queries using Joins and Aggregate functions

### Peer Programming Pair-Up

To encourage collaboration and a team environment, labs will be
structured in a *pair programming* setup.  At the start of
each lab, you may be randomly paired up with another student by
a lab instructor.  One of you will be designated the *driver* 
and the other the *navigator*.  

The navigator will be responsible for reading the instructions 
and telling the driver what is to be done.  The driver will be 
in charge of the keyboard and workstation.  Both driver and 
navigator are responsible for suggesting fixes and solutions 
*together*.  Neither the navigator nor the driver is "in charge."  
Beyond your immediate pairing, you are encouraged to help and 
interact and with other pairs in the lab.

Each week you should try to alternate: if you were a driver 
last week, be a navigator next, etc.  Resolve any issues (you 
were both drivers last week) within your pair.  Ask the lab 
instructor to resolve issues only when you cannot come to a 
consensus.  

Because of the peer programming setup of labs, it is absolutely 
essential that you complete any pre-lab activities and familiarize
yourself with the handouts prior to coming to lab.  Failure to do
so will negatively impact your ability to collaborate and work with 
others which may mean that you will not be able to complete the
lab.  

## 1. Getting Started

You can clone this project from GitHub, but this lab will not be using
the Eclipse IDE.  

## 2. Manipulating Data

We will continue to work with the Album database from the previous
lab.  For reference, the database schema is included here as an ER
Diagram:

</p>  

## 3. Activities 

### 3.1 Inserting & Manipulating Data

Data can be added to a database using `insert` queries and existing 
data in a database can be manipulated using `update` and `delete` 
queries. However, records in a table that may be referenced by records 
in other tables via a foreign key cannot be deleted unless the referencing 
records are handled first.  Likewise, data that requires a reference to 
data in other tables cannot be inserted prior to inserting the referenced 
records.

Write the following queries to manipulate data in the Albums database.
Refer to Lab 7.0 for installing the database if you need to.  Write your
queries in the provided `albumQueries.sql` file.

1. Choose your favorite album and insert it into the database by doing the
   following.
   1.  Write a query to insert the band of the album 
   2.  Write a query to insert the album 
   3.  Write two queries to insert the first two songs of the album
   4.  Write two queries to associate the two songs with the inserted album
2. Update the musician record for "P. Best", his first name should be "Pete".
3. Pete Best was the Beatle's original drummer, but was fired in 1962. 
   Write a query that removes Pete Best from the Beatles.
4. Attempt to delete the song "Big in Japan" (by Tom Waits on the album
   *Mule Variations*).  Observe that the query will fail due to referencing
   records. Write a series of queries that will allow you to delete the 
   album *Mule Variations*.

### 3.2 Altering a Database

New requirements may mean that the underlying data model must be modified 
to support new pieces of data. For example, if we wanted to keep track of 
the emails of each musician we could modify the `Musician` table to include 
an email address. SQL allows us to *alter* existing tables.  For example, the
following query will add a column to an existing table.

`alter table Musician add emailAddress varchar(50);`

However, this would mean that a musician could only ever have a single
email address (potentially violating first normal form).  A better solution 
would add support for multiple emails by adding an entirely new table.

```sql
create table Email (
  emailID int not null primary key auto_increment,
  musicianId int not null,
  address varchar(100) not null,
  foreign key `fk_email_to_musician` (musicianId) references Musician(musicianId)
);
```

You will modify the Albums database to add support for venues 
at which bands are under contract to play selected album songs. You will add 
tables and keys to this database to support this functionality

### 3.2.1 Designing Tables

Design comes before implementation.  Before we write SQL code to modify
our database, we'll first design the necessary tables.  Design entities 
and relation(s) to extend the albums database to support the following 
information about concerts.

-   The band playing at the concert

-   The band’s selected album songs to be played at the concert

-   The date the concert was held (Use an appropriately formatted `varchar`;
    date and time types are not generally cross-compatible in SQL).

-   The name of the venue where the concert was held

-   The number of seats at the venue

-   The number of concert tickets sold

Your solution may look something like the following (partial) ER Diagram.
<p align="center">
<img src="images/hint.png" 
     alt="Partial ER Diagram the Albums database" 
     width="75%"/>
</p>  
The `Song` table is part of the original Albums database. Relationships 
between two entities are indicated by a line between the two entities. 
In general, these indicate a one-to-many relationship. The ER Diagram
suggests that you'll want to design a *many-to-many* relationship between
concerts and songs using a join table (`ConcertSong`) since bands tend
to play more than one song at a concert and perform more than one concert.
As you design your tables, think of the following.

*   What primary and foreign keys should be included and how should they
    relate records in each of the tables?
    
*   How should the `Band` table relate to the `Concert` and/or `ConcertSong`
    tables?

*   Every concert takes place at a *venue* (a physical location).  
    Good normalization would require yet another table(s) and a relationship
    that models the fact that a venue can have multiple concerts.  

Work out your diagram on a piece of paper or *whiteboard* it before proceeding.

### 3.2.2 Creating Tables

After designing your new tables and relations, you will write SQL code
to create them.  Place code to create your tables in the same `albumQueries.sql`
file.  Keep in mind the following design principles.  

-   Naming - Use a uniform naming conventions for the tables and their
    fields

-   Field Types - Make sure to use appropriate types and a uniform
    typing conventions for each field

-   Primary keys - Make sure to specify which fields are primary keys

-   Foreign keys - Enforce appropriate foreign key restrictions to
    reflect each relation.

### 3.2.3 Using the New Tables

Insert some test data to make sure your queries worked and that your
design makes sense.  Add these queries to your `albumQueries.sql` file.

1.  Write queries to insert at least two `Concert` records.

2.  Write queries to associate at least 2 songs with each of the two
    concerts

3.  Write a select-join query to retrieve these new results and produce
    a playlist for each concert

### 4. Testing, Submitting & Grading

* Be sure all of your queries run in Workbench
* ***Important***: Be sure to remove or comment out the `use LOGIN;`
  line in your script before submitting (the grader will be using
  its own database, not yours)
* Submit your completed `albumQueries.sql` file through webhandin.
* Run the grader and verify the output to complete your lab.
